                The players thought he was 18 or 20. He was actually 12-15 years old. He never corrected them. He just kept showing up, kept playing, kept learning how to read people under pressure.

                  By the time Mikki walked into his first legal casino, he'd already spent years playing high-stakes card games with adults who wouldn't go easy on a kid. This wasn't beginner's luck—it was a decade of pattern recognition training before his first legal bet.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Mikki left his parents' house in 10th grade. Not because they threw him out, but because he couldn't stay. The household was broken. He gravitated toward the streets, where Italian mafia members took him in. They raised him, in a sense. Taught him things schools don't teach.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          At 15, he went to juvenile prison. He stayed there, with brief interruptions, until around age 21. During that time, he got his GED. He took the SATs while incarcerated. He applied to universities. Five accepted him. He never attended any of them.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          When he finally got out, he had no money, no job, and no plan. He ended up homeless in New York. Not the romanticized version. The actual streets. He got sober there, alone, with no program and no support system. Just survival.

                  "Juvenile detention was the worst jail I've ever been to. And I've been to some pretty rough jails. With kids, there's no consequences. You can hit a CO in the face and go to your room for three days. There's no charges."
                </p>
              </div>

              <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Most people assume juvenile detention is easier than adult prison. Mikki says the opposite. Juvenile facilities were more violent, more chaotic, and far more dangerous—precisely because there were no real consequences.
              </p>

              <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                A kid could assault a correctional officer and get sent to his room for three days. No charges filed. No extended sentence. Just a brief timeout before returning to the same environment.
              </p>

              <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                This absence of accountability created an environment where violence was routine. For Mikki, it was a masterclass in surviving environments where rules didn't matter and consequences didn't exist.

                  The "lack of consequence" mindset Mikki developed in juvenile detention later translated to his gambling approach. When you've lived in environments where the worst-case scenario was already your daily reality, casino surveillance and pit boss intimidation tactics don't work.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          A friend eventually got him a job at a rehab facility in Miami. $18 per hour. Mikki watched how the business worked. He studied the operations, the insurance billing, the patient intake systems. Within months, he understood the entire model.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Before that, though, he was a day laborer. $100 a day, cash. He saved every single dollar. He lived in the cheapest conditions possible and banked everything else. When he had enough, he bought his first rehab center. Then another. Then he expanded into pharmacies.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          By his mid-20s, Mikki had built a network of over 300 pharmacies and multiple rehab facilities across Florida. He sold the businesses while still in his 20s and retired. The exact sale price isn't public, but based on his subsequent lifestyle, it was substantial.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Then everything fell apart. His business partner was murdered. Another partner disappeared. He split with his girlfriend. He was alone again, but this time with money and no direction.

          Around 2020, Mikki moved to Los Angeles. He started going to Las Vegas. Not as a tourist, but as someone looking for patterns. He watched baccarat tables for hours before placing a single bet. He noticed things other players didn't see.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Dealer tells. Shoe patterns. The way pit bosses reacted under pressure. He claims casinos cheat, and that he reverse-engineered their methods. Whether that's true or not, what's documented is that he started winning. A lot.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          He averaged, by his own account, around $1 million per week during his peak. But he was strategic about it. Win $3 million, then disappear for three weeks. Let the heat die down. Then come back.

              <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Most blackjack tables cap at $50,000-$75,000 per hand. Even at high-roller rooms, that's the ceiling. Baccarat? If you have the credit and the track record, casinos will negotiate $250,000+ per hand.

          Mikki's buy-ins were $3 million at a time. He negotiated front money deals with casinos, where they'd extend him credit based on his verified assets. He played baccarat at $250,000 per hand. For comparison, blackjack limits at most casinos cap at $75,000.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          He didn't play like a gambler. He played like someone executing a system. Watch. Wait. Identify the pattern. Bet heavy when the conditions aligned. Walk away when they didn't.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          One of Mikki's most documented wins came at the Venetian in Las Vegas. Professional poker player Jake Ormand was present and later testified that Mikki won over $10 million at a single baccarat table. The casino reviewed the footage. No cheating. No card counting. Just pattern recognition and execution.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Not every session was a win. At the Wynn Las Vegas, Mikki actually lost money overall. He dropped $4 million, won back $2.5 million, and walked away with a net loss of $1.5 million. The Wynn still banned him.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Why ban a losing player? Because casinos saw the system. They saw that he wasn't gambling, he was executing. And they knew that over time, execution beats house edge.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          By 2023, Mikki had been banned from over 150 casinos. The reasons casinos gave were often absurd. One banned him for "touching too many forks" at the buffet. Another claimed he "scared a pit boss." A third said he got into a fight with a valet, even though Mikki wasn't in the state that day.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The real reason was simpler: he won too much, too consistently. Casinos are businesses. They don't owe anyone the right to play. If you cost them millions, they'll find a reason to remove you.

          Mikki's parents didn't believe him at first. A former addict and ex-con claiming to win millions from casinos? It sounded like a relapse story waiting to happen.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          So Mikki rented a villa. Threw a party. Bought his dad a Maybach and made him Vice President of a company he'd just created. His parents walked into the party, saw the wealth on display, and realized their son wasn't lying.

              <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Most gamblers think the edge is in the cards, the patterns, or the system. Mikki says the edge is in emotional regulation. The ability to stay calm when $3 million is on the table. The discipline to walk away after a win when every instinct says "keep playing."
              </p>

              <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                He's watched players with better pattern recognition lose millions because they couldn't control their emotions. They'd tilt after a loss. Chase their money. Make revenge bets.

              <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Mikki's superpower isn't seeing patterns—it's staying calm enough to execute on them. The clearer his mind, the better his decisions. The better his decisions, the more he wins. It's a compounding effect that starts with psychology, not mathematics.

                  Casinos don't fear players with systems. They fear players who can execute their system without emotion. Pattern recognition is useless if you panic under pressure. Mikki's juvenile detention experience—surviving environments where emotions got people hurt—trained him to stay calm when millions were at stake.

                Most high-stakes players implode the same way: they lose a big hand, get angry, make emotional bets, and blow through their bankroll in minutes. Casinos count on this. They design environments to trigger emotional reactions.

                Mikki learned in prison that expressing aggression outwardly gets you hurt. But channeling it inward—converting anger into focus—gives you an edge. When he loses a $250,000 hand, he doesn't slam the table. He gets quieter. More focused. More dangerous.

          This actually adds credibility to his story. If he claimed to crush every game, it would sound fake. The fact that he loses at poker but wins at baccarat suggests a real, specific edge rather than blind luck.
