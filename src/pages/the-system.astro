      <section class="mb-16 md:mb-20">
        <h2 class="text-white text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-6">What Is Baccarat?</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Baccarat is a casino card game where you bet on one of three outcomes: <strong class="text-white">Banker</strong>, <strong class="text-white">Player</strong>, or <strong class="text-white">Tie</strong>. Two hands are dealt (Player and Banker), and whichever is closer to 9 wins. You don't play the hand—you just bet on which side will win.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-900 border border-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6 md:p-8 mb-6">
          <h3 class="text-white text-xl font-bold mb-4">House Edge by Bet Type</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-300">
            <li><strong class="text-white">Banker Bet:</strong> 1.06% house edge (best odds)</li>
            <li><strong class="text-white">Player Bet:</strong> 1.24% house edge</li>
            <li><strong class="text-white">Tie Bet:</strong> 14.36% house edge (never bet this)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Unlike blackjack (where card counting works) or poker (where skill matters), baccarat is considered a <strong class="text-white">pure probability game</strong>. The house edge is small, but it's built in mathematically. Over time, the casino always wins.

        <h2 class="text-white text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Why Casinos Say Baccarat Is Unbeatable</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Professional gamblers and mathematicians agree: <strong class="text-white">baccarat cannot be beaten long-term</strong> through traditional advantage play techniques. Here's why:
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 to-black border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 rounded">
            <h3 class="text-white text-xl font-bold mb-3">1. Card Counting Doesn't Work</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              In blackjack, counting cards gives you a 1-2% edge. In baccarat, even perfect card counting gives you less than 0.1% edge—and only on specific hands. It's mathematically useless.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 to-black border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 rounded">
            <h3 class="text-white text-xl font-bold mb-3">2. Past Results Don't Affect Future Outcomes</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              The "Banker won 7 times in a row" pattern means nothing. Each hand is independent. This is basic probability theory—the gambler's fallacy.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 to-black border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 rounded">
            <h3 class="text-white text-xl font-bold mb-3">3. The House Edge Never Disappears</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Even if you bet perfectly, the 1.06% edge grinds you down over time. Bet $100M lifetime? You'll lose $1.06M on average. Math doesn't care about "systems."

            Every professional gambling expert—from Stanford Wong to Ed Thorp—agrees baccarat is unbeatable through pattern recognition. If Mikki has found an edge, it's not through traditional advantage play.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Mikki's system rejects traditional gambling theory. He claims casinos <strong class="text-white">actively cheat at baccarat</strong> through dealer manipulation, and that he <strong class="text-white">reverse-engineered their methods</strong> to beat them. Here's his approach:

                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Mikki watches tables for <strong class="text-white">hours</strong> before placing a single bet. He's looking for:

                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Unlike traditional "pattern betting" (which doesn't work), Mikki claims to identify <strong class="text-white">exploitable dealer errors</strong> and <strong class="text-white">mechanical predictability</strong> in how shoes are shuffled. This is distinct from the gambler's fallacy—he's not betting on streaks, he's betting on <strong class="text-white">human execution flaws</strong>.

                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  When patterns align, Mikki bets <strong class="text-white">$100,000 to $250,000 per hand</strong>. This isn't gradual grinding—it's surgical execution. He doesn't play for hours. He plays for <strong class="text-white">minutes</strong>, extracting $1-3M, then leaves.

                  After winning, Mikki doesn't return for <strong class="text-white">weeks</strong>. This prevents casinos from studying his play or adjusting their procedures.

          Mikki's approach requires <strong class="text-white">massive capital</strong>. Here's why:

        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 to-black border border-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6 md:p-8 mb-6">

          Why so much? <strong class="text-white">Variance</strong>. Even with an edge, you can lose millions in a single session. Mikki's documented <a href="/wins" class="text-gold hover:text-gold-light underline">$1.5M loss at the Wynn</a> shows this isn't risk-free. You need enough capital to survive losing streaks until patterns align again.

          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Even if Mikki's system works, you likely can't execute it. Here's why:
          </p>
          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-300">
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">You don't have $10M+ in capital</strong> (required to survive variance)</li>
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">You don't have 5+ years of pattern recognition training</strong></li>
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">You don't have casino host relationships</strong> to negotiate $250K/hand limits</li>
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">You'll get banned immediately</strong> if you try to replicate this at scale</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Mikki shares insights in his <a href="/join" class="text-gold hover:text-gold-light underline">free Telegram community</a>, but he doesn't promise anyone will replicate his results. He's transparent that his system requires <strong class="text-white">resources 99.9% of people don't have</strong>.
