  // Baccarat-Specific Terms
  {
    term: "Baccarat",
    definition: "A card game where players bet on whether the 'Banker' or 'Player' hand will have a total closest to 9. The house edge is 1.06% on Banker bets and 1.24% on Player bets, making it one of the lowest house edge games in casinos.",
    category: "Baccarat"
  },
  {
    term: "Banker Bet",
    definition: "A bet in baccarat that the Banker hand will win. This bet has a 1.06% house edge and pays 1:1 (minus a 5% commission on wins). Despite the commission, it's statistically the best bet in baccarat.",
    category: "Baccarat"
  },
  {
    term: "Player Bet",
    definition: "A bet in baccarat that the Player hand will win. This bet has a 1.24% house edge and pays 1:1 (no commission). Slightly worse odds than the Banker bet, but still one of the best bets in the casino.",
    category: "Baccarat"
  },
  {
    term: "Tie Bet",
    definition: "A bet in baccarat that both the Banker and Player hands will have the same total. Pays 8:1 or 9:1 depending on the casino, but has a massive 14.36% house edge. Professional players never make this bet.",
    category: "Baccarat"
  },
  {
    term: "Natural",
    definition: "In baccarat, a two-card hand totaling 8 or 9. A natural 9 is the best possible hand. If either the Player or Banker is dealt a natural, no additional cards are drawn.",

    term: "Shoe",
    definition: "The card holder used in baccarat (and blackjack) that contains multiple decks of cards. Most baccarat games use 6 or 8 decks. The shoe is shuffled between rounds (or after a certain number of cards are dealt).",
    category: "Baccarat"
  },
  {
    term: "Burn Card",
    definition: "The first card dealt from a new shoe in baccarat (or after a shuffle). The burn card is discarded and not used in play. Some advantage players believe burn card patterns can be exploited.",

    definition: "The 5% fee casinos charge on winning Banker bets in baccarat. For example, if you bet $100 on Banker and win, you receive $195 (your $100 bet + $100 win - $5 commission).",
    category: "Baccarat"
  },
  {
    term: "Mini-Baccarat",
    definition: "A smaller, faster version of baccarat with lower minimum bets (often $10-$25). Played on a blackjack-sized table with one dealer. Full baccarat (also called 'big baccarat') is slower and has higher minimums ($100+).",
    category: "Baccarat"
  },
  {
    term: "Punto Banco",
    definition: "The most common form of baccarat played in North American and European casinos. 'Punto' means Player, 'Banco' means Banker. The rules are fixed (no player decisions beyond choosing which bet to make).",
    category: "Baccarat"
  },
  {
    term: "Dragon Bonus",
    definition: "A popular side bet in baccarat that pays based on the margin of victory. For example, if the Banker wins by 9 points, the payout is 30:1. Like all side bets, the house edge is much higher than the main game.",

  },
  {
    term: "Squeeze",

    category: "Baccarat"
  },

  // Advantage Play & Strategy
  {
    term: "Advantage Play",

    category: "Advantage Play"
  },
  {
    term: "Pattern Recognition",
    definition: "The technique Mikki Mase claims to use: observing baccarat shoes for exploitable patterns (dealer tells, mechanical shuffling errors, statistical deviations). Not proven to work mathematically, but Mikki claims it's how he won millions.",
    category: "Advantage Play"
  },
  {
    term: "Card Counting",
    definition: "Tracking the ratio of high cards to low cards in blackjack to determine when the deck favors the player. Legal but banned by casinos. Does NOT work in baccarat (the edge is negligible even with perfect counting).",
    category: "Advantage Play"
  },
  {
    term: "Edge Sorting",
    definition: "Exploiting manufacturing defects in card backs to identify face-down cards. Phil Ivey won £7.7 million using this technique at baccarat. UK courts ruled it was cheating, and Ivey never received his winnings.",
    category: "Advantage Play"
  },
  {
    term: "Dealer Tells",
    definition: "Physical cues from dealers that reveal information about face-down cards. Examples: card placement timing, shuffling patterns, body language. Mikki Mase claims dealer tells are a key part of his system.",

  },
  {
    term: "Betting Spread",
    definition: "The ratio between a player's minimum and maximum bets. Card counters use large betting spreads (1:10 or more) to maximize profits when the count is favorable. Casinos flag players with suspicious betting spreads.",

  {
    term: "Expected Value (EV)",
    definition: "The average amount you expect to win or lose per bet over the long term. Calculated as (Probability of Winning × Win Amount) - (Probability of Losing × Loss Amount). Positive EV = profit, Negative EV = loss.",
    category: "Advantage Play"
  },
  {
    term: "Variance",
    definition: "The statistical measure of how much your results deviate from the expected value. High-variance games (like slots) have wild swings. Low-variance games (like baccarat) have more consistent results.",
    category: "Advantage Play"
  },

  // Casino Operations
  {
    term: "House Edge",
    definition: "The mathematical advantage the casino has over the player, expressed as a percentage. For example, the house edge on Banker bets in baccarat is 1.06%, meaning the casino expects to keep $1.06 for every $100 wagered (on average).",
    category: "Casino Operations"
  },
  {
    term: "Pit Boss",
    definition: "The casino supervisor who oversees table games. Pit bosses watch for cheating, advantage play, and suspicious behavior. They have the authority to back off players or issue bans. Mikki has been backed off by pit bosses hundreds of times.",
    category: "Casino Operations"
  },
  {
    term: "Eye in the Sky",

    category: "Casino Operations"
  },
  {
    term: "Comp",
    definition: "Short for 'complimentary.' Free goods and services casinos give to players (rooms, meals, drinks, show tickets). Comps are based on your 'theo' (theoretical loss). High rollers like Mikki get massive comps (private jets, penthouse suites).",
    category: "Casino Operations"
  },
  {
    term: "Theo (Theoretical Loss)",
    definition: "The amount the casino expects you to lose based on your average bet, hours played, and house edge. Used to calculate comps. Example: If you bet $10,000/hand at baccarat for 4 hours, your theo is ~$4,000 (casinos comp 30-40% of theo).",
    category: "Casino Operations"
  },
  {
    term: "Marker",
    definition: "A line of credit issued by the casino. High rollers sign markers instead of using cash. Mikki often played with $3 million markers. If you don't pay back the marker, it's treated like a bad check (criminal charges).",
    category: "Casino Operations"
  },
  {
    term: "Front Money",
    definition: "Cash deposited with the casino before gambling. Unlike markers (credit), front money is YOUR money. Casinos hold it in a cage account, and you draw against it at the tables. Mikki often deposited $5-10 million in front money.",

  },
  {
    term: "Cage",

  },
  {
    term: "Shuffle",

  {
    term: "Cut Card",
    definition: "A plastic card inserted into the shoe to mark when the shuffle will occur. When the dealer reaches the cut card, they finish the current hand and then shuffle. The placement of the cut card affects how many hands are dealt per shoe.",
